    "\n",
    "This project studies a systematic options wheel strategy implemented on listed American-style equity options written on U.S. large-cap stocks. The framework combines equity selection and option premium harvesting within a unified backtesting structure. The objective is to evaluate whether disciplined short-volatility exposure, when applied to a selected set of liquid underlying equities, can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over an extended sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy operates through monthly rolling option positions while maintaining a multi-year investment horizon to ensure exposure across different market regimes. Both assignment and premium collection dynamics are explicitly modeled, allowing the portfolio to alternate between cash-secured puts and covered calls. Capital allocation, transaction costs, and execution frictions are incorporated to ensure realistic performance estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtest spans more than five years and includes at least five distinct underlying equities, generating sufficient trade frequency for statistical evaluation. Performance is assessed across full-sample and stressed market environments in order to evaluate robustness under varying volatility conditions."
